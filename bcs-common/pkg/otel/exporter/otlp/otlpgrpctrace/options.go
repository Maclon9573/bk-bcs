//func WithInsecure() otlptracegrpc.Option {
//	return otlptracegrpc.WithInsecure()

//// WithEndpoint allows one to set the endpoint that the exporter will
//// connect to the collector on. If unset, it will instead try to use
//// connect to DefaultCollectorHost:DefaultCollectorPort.
//func WithEndpoint(endpoint string) otlptracegrpc.Option {

//// after failing to connect with the collector.

//// WithCompressor will set the compressor for the gRPC client to use when sending requests.
//// It is the responsibility of the caller to ensure that the compressor set has been registered
//// with google.golang.org/grpc/encoding. This can be done by encoding.RegisterCompressor. Some

//// `import _ "google.golang.org/grpc/encoding/gzip"`.

//// WithTLSCredentials allows the connection to use TLS credentials
//// when talking to the server. It takes in grpc.TransportCredentials instead
//// of say a Certificate file or a tls.Certificate, because the retrieving of
//// these credentials can be done in many ways e.g. plain file, in code tls.Config
//// or by certificate rotation, so it is up to the caller to decide what to use.

//// endpoints are not overwhelmed with retries. If unset, the default retry
//// policy will retry after 5 seconds and increase exponentially after each
//// error for a total of 1 minute.
